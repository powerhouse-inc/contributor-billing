# Contributor-billing
The Contributor billing package allows contributors of open organisations to get paid in cash and crypto valuta's anonymously for their work. Download the package and install it in your organisation with the Connect app. Or install it in a local copy of the Connect app for development purposes with the command: 'pnpm install @powerhouse/contributor-billing'.
